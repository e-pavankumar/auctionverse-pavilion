# Backend Directory

This directory contains all backend-related code for the AuctionVerse application.

## Structure

- `/api`: Contains API endpoints and business logic
  - `auth.js`: Authentication functions (sign in, sign up, etc.)
  - `auctions.js`: Auction-related functions (get auctions, place bids, etc.)

## Integration with Frontend

In a production environment, you would typically:

1. Move this backend code to a separate server application
2. Set up proper database connections (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
3. Implement security measures (password hashing, JWT verification, etc.)
4. Set up environment variables for sensitive information
5. Create API routes with Express.js or a similar framework

## Current Implementation

The current implementation is a mock backend that simulates API calls with 
delays and in-memory data storage. This is suitable for frontend development 
and testing but should be replaced with a real backend implementation 
before deployment.

## Supabase Integration

For a production-ready backend with minimal setup, consider using the 
Lovable Supabase integration, which provides:

- Authentication (email/password, social logins)
- Database (PostgreSQL)
- Storage (files, images)
- Realtime subscriptions
- Edge Functions

You can enable this integration through the Lovable interface.
